				This represents the success or failure of the transmission.
				It will also be returned as the HTTP response code.

				400 =
					XML Parse Error (ParseError field will be Microsoft error number)
					Invalid Customer Specification (ParseError will be 1)
				202 =
					Accepted for Processing (only when NOW process flag is not set)
				406 =
					Parsed, but data failed checks. Shipment data violates basic rules.
						(Often this is due to invalid user or customer information.)
						(Can only happen when NOW process flag is set)
				200 =
					Parsed and saved correctly.
						(May still contain processing errors. Should be accessible in client Clarity site for manual review, editing, and submission.)
				500 =
					Handled Internal Database Error (occurs in a variety of situations; generally shipment is not considered successfully processed)
					Handled Internal Script Error (occurs in a variety of situations; generally shipment is not considered successfully processed)

				Note that it is possible that unhandled errors may occur, which will result in an HTTP status code of 500 with no reliable acknowledgement XML.

		<TotalCharges>0</TotalCharges>

			<!--
				This will be the sum of the total estimated charges for the shipment.
				These charges, as with the web order entry system, are only estimates. Various issues can arise throughout the course of a shipment which will result in additional charges.
				For some customers, the rates are unique and not automatically calculated by the system.
					Often, the total charges for shipments for those customers will appear as 0.
					However, it is possible that they will simply be erroneous.
				The same charge automation is used for the web order entry system and the XML system.
					If the customer is concerned with the validity of the information, the customer should consult with an account manager before relying upon it.
				This is only relevant when the CHARGES process flag is set.

				This agent information is only present when the DELAGENT process flag is set. It is intended for use with Last Mile programs where the customer drops freight at our destination provider.
				This is the address and contact information for the agent which will accept the delivery from the customer's carrier. It is usually the agent who will perform the final delivery.
				Very loose validation rules are applied to the information, so do not rely on certain formats for phone number or email.
