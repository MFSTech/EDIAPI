				Each type of box being shipped should be represented by its own piece line.

				The Pieces, Length, Width, Height, Actual Weight, and Declared Value inputs
					must be numeric. The length, width, and height fields should be whole numbers
					representing total inches of each dimension. The Actual Weight must be in pounds.
					The declared value must be in US Dollars.

				The Pieces field should be a whole number representing the number of boxes
					of that physical size and weight.

				The Product ID, Name, Description, and Type fields can be specified
					and will appear on various documents.

				The Product Type must be specified by some customers as it impacts rates and insurance.
					The product type must be one of an enumerated list which will be provided by our sales,
					operations, or technical staff.
					In cases where multiple product types are within the same box, you must specify
					the most expensive and/or fragile product type.
					For example, if a plasma TV and a receiver are in the same box, the Product Type for that
					piece line should be "Plasma TV", not "Receiver".

				The length, width, height, actual weight, and declared value must all be specified
					PER PIECE (i.e. per box).
					For example, if there are two plasma TVs per box and each is worth $5000, and there
					are 5 such boxes, the Pieces field should be "5" and the PieceDecVal field should be "10000".

				PiecePrep should be used to specify any special preparation which the client expects
					to be performed. Some customers have arranged to have some of their products
					banded to pallets and are charged accordingly. The value in this field must
					be one of an enumerated list which will be provided by our sales,
					operations, or technical staff.

				PieceSTC is short for Piece Said to Contain. For situations where multiple boxes are secured to a pallet,
					the pallet and its overall dimensions will be considered a single "piece" and will generally be
					moved as, and charged for as, a single unit. However, it is valuable for us to know the number
					of identifiable boxes on the pallet to eliminate potential confusion and to assist with
					producing extra labels in case the boxes become separated.
